## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Azure OpenAI API access

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd DePaulProject
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Extract compressed files**
   ```bash
   # Extract the sentence transformer model
   unzip model.zip -d content/
   
   # Extract knowledge graph (if needed)
   unzip knowledge_graph\(3\).gexf.zip
   ```

5. **Configure environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your-azure-openai-api-key"
   MONGO_URI="your-mongodb-connection-string"
   ```

   Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
   ```toml
   AZURE_OPEN_AI_KEY="your-azure-openai-api-key"
   MONGO_URI="your-mongodb-connection-string"
   ```

6. **Set up Azure OpenAI**
   - Ensure you have access to GPT-4o-mini model
   - Update the endpoint and deployment name in `main.py` if different:
     ```python
     endpoint = "https://aoai-camp.openai.azure.com/"
     deployment = "abbott_researcher"
     ```

7. **Set up MongoDB**
   - Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster
   - Add your connection string to the environment files
   - The system will automatically create the required collections

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Streamlit application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

2. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`
   - Use the interface to perform searches on medical diagnostic devices

## 📖 Usage

### Normal Search
- Best for quick queries using pre-indexed medical literature
- Utilizes vector similarity search and knowledge graph filtering
- Provides fast responses with quality assessment

### Deep Search
- Comprehensive search including real-time ArXiv paper retrieval
- Breaks down complex queries into multiple sub-queries
- Combines local knowledge base with latest research papers
- Takes longer but provides more thorough coverage

### Search Tips
- Use specific medical device names for better results
- Ask comparative questions (e.g., "What is the best glucose monitor?")
- Include context about intended use or patient population

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Models and Embeddings
- **Sentence Transformer**: `pritamdeka/S-BioBert-snli-multinli-stsb`
- **Vector Database**: FAISS with L2 normalization
- **Language Model**: Azure OpenAI GPT-4o-mini

### Data Sources
- Pre-indexed medical literature chunks
- Real-time ArXiv paper retrieval
- Knowledge graph with medical entities and relationships

### Evaluation Metrics
The system includes built-in evaluation using RAGAS metrics:
- Answer relevancy
- Faithfulness to source material
- Context precision and recall
- Answer correctness and similarity
